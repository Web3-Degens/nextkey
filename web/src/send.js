/**
 * The playground — NextKey with your hands on it.
 *
 * poc.html shows a secret that already exists. This page lets a visitor make
 * one. Everything below happens in the browser: the same X25519 + HKDF-SHA256 +
 * AES-256-GCM that scripts/nextkey-core.mjs performs on a laptop, executed here
 * so that the loop can be completed in thirty seconds by somebody who has
 * neither a wallet nor testnet ether.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately *not* simplified for the sake of the demo:
 *
 *   The cryptography is the real thing. Not a mock, not a hash of a hash — the
 *   identical construction, so a grant produced on this page can be opened by
 *   the command-line tool and the other way round. A demo that fakes the one
 *   part that matters demonstrates nothing.
 *
 *   Opening is only possible for a recipient whose private key exists here.
 *   Grant to a real ENS name and this page will encrypt to the key that name
 *   publishes and then tell you, plainly, that it cannot open the result. That
 *   is not a missing feature. It is the property the product is built on, and
 *   hiding it would be the lie.
 *
 * Steps 1 to 3 need no wallet, no account and no ether: a phrase, a recipient,
 * and the three records that would go on chain. Step 4 puts them there — either
 * with the visitor's own wallet on a name they own, or with a key this page
 * publishes, which owns nothing and may write only to a pool of names set aside
 * for it. Steps 5 and 6 then open and revoke by reading those records back off
 * the chain, not out of this tab's memory, because a refusal computed locally
 * proves less than one that survives a round trip through ENS.

// few cents of testnet ether, and may write records on one pool of our names
// and on nothing else. One click, no wallet, works on a phone. It is disclosed
// rather than hidden — see src/demo-wallet.js — because a demo of a security
// product that relies on nobody looking is not a demo of anything.
//

// same construction, opened in step 5 by reading them back off the chain
// rather than out of this tab's memory.

 * It is `t.wallet.none` and not `t.s6.nowallet`, which was the obvious name and
 * is already taken — by a retired sentence from an older version of this panel,
 * still sitting in all nine languages. `i18n-merge` refused to overwrite it and

//
// A name publishes one ephemeral key and one ciphertext. Each recipient's ECDH
// with that one key lands somewhere else, so a second grant is one more record
// and shares no key material with the first. Nothing is re-encrypted, nothing
// is replaced, and revoking one leaves the other untouched — which is the
// difference between granting access and handing over a copy.
//
// What it costs is one setText. On the lent-name lane the page's own key signs
// it; on your own name your wallet does. Neither needs a fresh derivation
// signature, because the ephemeral private key is still in this tab from step
// 4 — a reloaded page would have to re-derive it, which is what
// `nextkey.mjs share` does on the command line.
